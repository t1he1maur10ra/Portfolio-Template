        <h3>Getting Started</h3>
            
        <p>To start making applications in C#, there are a couple of things we need to make sure that we understand befor we dive into coding. 
            The first thing we need to cover is which IDE (Integrated development environment) we will use. Throughout this and subsequent courses 
            there are two main IDE's you will need to be familiar with, the first is Visual Studio and the second is Visual Studio Code.
            The second thing we need to look at is GitHub. GitHub is a version control provider which enables us to work on code, upload it to cloud storage, 
            share and collaborate on projects from anywhere with an internet connection. 
        </p>
